/**
 * Typography-related Sass placeholder classes
 *
 * This provides realignment to make heading text better fit its containing block. The
 * pseudo-elements cause heading elements to only be as tall as an uppercase "T". This makes the
 * baseline of the typography align with the bottom of the element. Decending characters will extend
 * outside of the element, and tall ascenders may extend out the top. Using pseudo-elements allows
 * the margins of the headings to be set as usual by other styles.
